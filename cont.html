    <p class = "text">
       As a freshman, I had to learn some of the ways we can make our drive train control more robust and less prone to outside
        disturbances the goal was to understand feedback control loop systems and gains to optimize our turning and
        have a robust drive system. <br><br>

        it is called a feedback control loop because our error is always fed back into the equations that we use to figure
        out how much power we need to give to the motors. The green box represents the robot, the green arrow coming from it
        represents the actual turn degree that the robot is using, this is referred to as the actual value.
        The brown arrow represents where we actually want to go in degrees, this will be referred to as the desired value.
        We find the error value or the change by subtracting the the desired value from the actual value.
        The Kp value represents the turning coefficient, if the value is greater then the turns will be faster,
        but the tradeoff is that we run the risk of overshooting and missing our target angle. If we have the turning
        coefficient too low however, than we run the risk of going so slow that we may never be able to hit the
        target thanks to forces such as friction on the <br> <br>

        One last important thing is that we assume through convention that the rightward direction indicates positive direction.
        The motor power that we set is the Kp turning coefficient multiplied by the error. Say that our desired angle is 0 a
        nd we need to go 5 that means we have an error of -5. This means that we need to spin to the left, or that we need to
        spin the right motors forward and the left motors back. This means we have our delta Pr value with a (-) at the front,
        the (-) and the negative error will cancel out leaving us with a positive right motor value.
        This concludes the preliminary explanation of the feedback control loop system. <br><br>

        We implemented this feedback loop into our gyro sensor, using a proportional controller to have accurate turning using
        this feedback loop.
