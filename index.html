           Hello there, my name is Mannan Shukla. Welcome to my FTC portfolio. This site will
           probably serve as my personal site as well. On this site, you will hopefully have a pretty good
           understanding of what exactly I do on Nemesis Prime 14020 and my plans moving forward. You may be able
           to see what actually goes behind the technological decisions I make (yes, I indeed use Fedora Linux on
           an old HP laptop) and my motivations. This website was made in all HTML5/CSS3. All code on this website
           is my own, expect for small things I may need to look up. This was all coded in either Visual Studio Code
           or WebStorm and tested for Firefox Quantum 65. All soruce code for this site is open, and
           always will be. You can find me on GitHub

        <p class = "text">Now there is a good chance that you may want to get in touch with me. If that is the case,
        then this div serves that exact purpose. </p>
