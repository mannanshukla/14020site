            To Mrs. Young: Thank You for always staying positive with our judging and preparing us to be able to talk outside our comfort zone.
            <br>
            <br>
            To Mr. Young: Thanks You for giving us a space to be able to share our ideas properly and effectively. Your help to me on the build side
            is something i'll always remember.
            <br>
            <br>
            To Mr. Brady: Thank You so much for providing the strong leadership that our team needs. You are the most unconventional teacher I have
            ever seen in my life, and that's a great thing. You always step outside the box and introduced me to some great experiences.
            <br>
            <br>
            To Mr. Huang: Mr. Huang. Without you, this website would have not been possible. You made me see software in a new way by introducing me
            to version control and GitHub. I also thank you for showing me around BASH (This really helped me later) and showing everyone how to use
            the IDE properly, Now I am faster and more efficient in one. Your knowledge in software has motivated me to work even harder moving forward.
            <br>
            <br>
            To Mr. Keller: Mr. Keller, this has been a great season. You have been my gateway into robotics programming and thanks to your explanations,
            I don't think i'll ever be able to give it up. You have saved us from a lot of confusion and struggle, while also letting us struggle in the
            pursuit of learning. Your right before competition pep talks have given us hope that yes, the problem will be there tomorrow. Thank you for
            letting the software team grow.
