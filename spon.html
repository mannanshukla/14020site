        After compition season was winding down, the whole team sat together to talk about Sponsor Night. Sponsor Night is an evening where we invite
        our sponsors to show demos of our robot, and our team accomplishments. We spent this intial planning stage assigning roles to members. I was
        assigned with manning the Programming Table, where sponsors could walk up and get a good idea of the exiting things we use code for.
        <br><br>
        After this, we had to split off and work on our own projects. I decided on having cards that detailed some of the important subsystems that
        we used for our code along with a diagram that could help. I also created an interactive slideshow, which showed video demonstrations of the
        code that I talked about. I also had been prepared to go more in-depth into the individual concepts that sponsors would be interested in. It
        was also a priority to show how we used the Engineering Design Process when coming up with potential solutions.
        <br><br>
        Then the fateful evening came, After the opening speeches and remarks, I was ready with my Elitebook and a external monitor. I could control my
        laptop and the presentation could be seen by the sponsors. Many sponsors had interest in what I was saying, and mostly had questions about
        the vision like Tensorflow Scan and Tensorflow Checkpoint. At the end of it all, I came away with on simple fact: It's crucial to tailor your
        content to your audience. Its important to allude to interesting things while keeping the terminology universally understandable. It was
        a great experience. After the table, I went to make conversation with parents and sponsors during dinner. We discussed sports, careers, and
        the rapid advancements in technology. Sponsor Night was an unforgettable evening indeed.
