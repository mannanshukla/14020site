    <p class = "largeText">Tensorflow Scan:</p>

    <p class = "text">The 25 point sampling mission was very crucial to maximizing auton, we had to find the gold mineral fast and
                      and find it every time. Some ways we thought about finding the mineral were using a color sensor that would detect
                      the colors of every mineral one by one. This would be inefficient however, because the robot would have to look at
                      each mineral one by one. <br> <br>

                      The FTC SDK actually provides a Tensorflow Lite model that has already been trained to tell the difference between the Gold and
                      Silver minerals. Not only does this make the process much faster, but it also won't get confused when shown other object with the same colors.
                      The Tensorflow library also lets us get pixel values on each object. The Tensorflow scanning process counts all of the recognitions the engine finds
                      and puts it into an arraylist. Then its puts a label of either GOLD_MINERAL or SILVER_MINERAL which we can read when looping through. After these pixel values on
                      the objects are found, we put them through our pixel to angle logic. <br> <br>

                      Once the webcam sees the gold mineral, we find the left and right pixel values, then average them. Then we find half the horizontal pixel axis, which is 400 pixels.
                      We then find the difference between the object pixel value and half the axis. We save this value. We then create a ratio of the field of view (in this case its 70 degrees)
                      and the total amount of pixels in the y axis, which would be 800. Then we multiply the saved value of the difference and the ratio we already found. This returns an angle. We feed 
                      it to the gyro and turn to the gold mineral. <br><br>
