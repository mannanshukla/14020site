    <p class = "largeText">Sponsor Walk:</p>
    <p class = "text">One of the first marketing tasks we had was to write an "elevator pitch". These were 30 second speeches that were
                      meant to explain what our team was, and what our personal contribution was going to be. My elevator pitch explained my
                      previous experience in Java, and what I wanted to accomplish on the team. This was, of course to make code for the robot.
                      Mrs. Young and Mr. Brady required every single person on the team to present their elevator pitches to the rest of the team,
                      just as they were going to talk to a potential sponsor. Out of the group, people were picked to participate in the first ever sponsor walk
                      of the season. <br><br>

                      After the people were chosen and isolated, we had to practice even harder, get the pitch memorized and optimize it for whatever situation we would
                      be in. We were also prepared in FAQs such as our other sponsors, what FTC actually is, and why they should sponsor us, along with the benefits of such
                      a sponsorship. We also had to practice our handshakes as well as speaking with other people while showing consistency.<br><br>

                      Then the day actually came, we walked around Town Center and talked to almost every business there, at first we were all going together. Then we split off
                      so people could have more time to describe themselves. One of the highlights was Gloria Nilson Realtors, where we got to meet with the CEO of the company who happened
                      to be at the Robbinsville Branch. She was interested in the initial pitch and called us into the conference room, where we further discussed sponsorship. The CEO was intrigued
                      and offered a $2000 Platinum Level sponsorship.
