    <p class = "largeText">FTC Portfolio:</p>
    <p class = "text">As a member of the software team on FTC 14020 Nemesis Prime, I was tasked with making sure the robot
                      was always in control. Whether its through teleop optimization, or control systems for the drivetrain.
                      It could be using vision processing for navigation, or for completing missions effectively. It could
                      even be trying to use systems that make sure the robot always stays on course. Overall, the software team
                       was to make sure the robot always responded to commands</p>
