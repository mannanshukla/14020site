    <p class = "largeText">Overview:</p>
    <p class = "text">As a member of the software team on FTC 14020 Nemesis Prime, I was tasked with making sure the robot
                      was always in control. Whether its through teleop optimization, or control systems for the drivetrain.
                      It could be using vision processing for navigation, or for completing missions effectively. It could
                      even be trying to use systems that make sure the robot always stays on course. Overall, the software team
                      was to make sure the robot always responded to commands and work as intended. FTC isn't just about robots though,
                      in the beginning of the year, everyone on the team was required to write an elevator pitch. After selecting people
                      Ms. Young brought the group together to embark on 2018-2019's first sponsor walk. It was my pleasure to be a part
                      of this group, where I got to talk personally to potential sponsors about my plans moving with the team and what our
                      team was all about.
