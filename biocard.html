Frair’s Case Notes:
</h1>
</center>
<h2 id="what-are-my-intentions">What are my intentions?</h2>
<p>to keep the peace in verona, and to ensure this at all costs</p>
<h2 id="marrying-minors-without-consent">marrying minors without consent</h2>
<p>this was only to make sure that Romeo and Juliet could live their lives</p>
<p>how <em>they</em> wanted to live them, Without the intervention of the parents</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of “minor” is relatively recent, laws concerning children as an entity didn’t really exist, but they were held back because without parents they would die with no money</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="providing-questionable-substances">Providing questionable substances</h2>
<p>The friar never gave anything fatal, the sleeping potion was only to</p>
<p>help juliet live out her life how she wanted, and the marriage would</p>
<p>help ease the tensions between the two house</p>
<p>Juliet asked for something that would allow her to escape her marriage,</p>
<p>you simply gave her something that would allow that, she was told about all of the effects,</p>
<p>and you as the towns Priest were a Practicing physician</p>
<h2 id="not-informing-all-parties-involved">not informing all parties involved</h2>
<h3 id="marriage">Marriage</h3>
<p>this was becuase the parents, in their fixed mindsets,</p>
<p>would not let the marriage happen anyway, so this was the only way to make progress</p>
<h3 id="fake-death">Fake Death</h3>
<p>This was to help Juliet cope with her forced marriage with Paris</p>
<p>and she was going to commit suicide anyway, this only helped her live, and gave her hope</p>
<h2 id="assisting-with-the-suicides">Assisting with the Suicides</h2>
<p>This was not the Friars fault, but the parent’s, they kids had no choice and</p>
<p>constantly mentioned suicide, the friar tried his best to stop this, and keep</p>
<p>the kids happy, the parent’s forced union of juliet and paris only contributed</p>
<p>to the suicide</p>
<p><strong>Juliet made a confession to the priest, he was not supposed to disclose any info</strong></p>
<h2 id="murder-of-paris">Murder of Paris</h2>
<p>This is of course not the friar’s fault, it was Pari’s misguided judgement</p>
<p>that kickstarted the duel between Romeo and Paris where Romeo himself killed Paris</p>
<h2 id="assiting-in-the-fake-death-of-juliet">assiting in the fake death of Juliet</h2>
<p>this was to make sure Juliet could have some hope in living out</p>
<p>her life at all, without the worry of her parents and the pressures that were on juliet</p>
<h2 id="aiding-romeo-a-criminal">Aiding romeo (a criminal)</h2>
<h3 id="escape">escape</h3>
<p>Romeo was exciled anyway, he was not shunned</p>
<h3 id="letter">letter</h3>
<p>this was to help juliet stay with romeo so juliet can live out her own life as</p>
<p>she pleased, without parents getting in the way</p>
