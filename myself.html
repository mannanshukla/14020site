                I would describe myself as a technology enthusiast. I joined FTC 14020 in the hopes that
                I would get to use some of my Java skills to control the robot and learn more about what goes into programming
                something that goes beyond just the command line. After this season, I came away with valuable skills such as git version
                control, getting around the linux terminal, working with computer vision and control systems. Beyond robotics, I put
                my time into ricing my Linux environment, school activities and playing quality games on my Wii. I hope to go to University
                of California, Berkeley majoring in Computer Science. I hope to work in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine
                Learning.</p>
